page.title=alfresco/renderers/Thumbnail
page.description=The thumbnail is a multi-purpose renderer that has the primary purpose of showing a small preview of the Node that it represents. However it is also possible for thumbnails to be used for linking, selecting or indicating selection and displaying larger previewers. It is possible to control how preview images are displayed in terms of aspect ratio and cropping or stretching.

example1.title=Alignment and Dimensions
example1.description=It is possible to configure the vertical and horizontal alignment of the thumbnail within the element that it is added to. Vertical alignment can be either "TOP", "MIDDLE" or "BOTTOM" and horizontal alignment can be "LEFT", "MIDDLE" or "RIGHT". It is also possible to configure the dimensions of the thumbnail as well as setting the margin around the thumbnail.

example2.title=Shadow, Cropping and Rendition
example2.description=In this example we are switching rendition to use the "imgpreview" (rather than the default of "doclib"). It is also applying a shadow around the thumbnail, but most significant is the use of "cropToFit" to fit the thumbnail into the dimensions provided. Note in this case that the landscape thumbnail is cropped equally on both sides, whereas the portrait thumbnail is cropped equally from the top and bottom.

example3.title=Stretch to fit
example3.description=In this example the image landscape thumbnail is squashed horizontally, but the portrait thgumbnail is cropped JUST at the bottom. This might seem strange but this actually represents the behaviour found in the original Gallery View found in the Share Document Library and has been retained in order to optionally provide consistency with existing expectations.

example4.title=Show preview
example4.description=By default when you click on a thumbnail it will attempt to navigate you to the details page for that Node in Alfresco Share. However, when you configure 'showDocumentPreview' to be true (and the Node has a rendition available to preview) the appropriate previewer will be displayed. In this case, a lightbox is opened to show a preview.

example5.title=Select on click
example5.description=Normally nodes are selected using the 'alfresco/renderers/Selector' widget, but it is possible to configure the thumbnail to be used to both allow clicking for selection as well as purely indicating when selection occurs ('updateOnSelection'). It is possible to still perform the default action (showing a preview or publishing a payload) as well as selection by configuring 'onlySelectOnClick' to be false.

example6.title=Publications
example6.description=By default a thumbnail will attempt to publish requests to navigate the user to the details page in Alfresco Share for the represented Node. However, thumbnails can be reconfigured to publish custom payloads on custom topics using the usual publication configuration options, i.e; 'publishTopic', 'publishPayload', 'publishGlobal', 'publishToParent', 'publishPayloadType', 'publishPayloadItemMixin' and 'publishPayloadModifiers'.
