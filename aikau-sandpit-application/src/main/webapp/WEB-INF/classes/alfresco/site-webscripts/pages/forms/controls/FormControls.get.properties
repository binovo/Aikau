page.title=Form Controls
page.description=All form controls extend the 'alfresco/forms/controls/BaseFormControl' module in order to inherit common behaviour and design. This page shows examples of that common behaviour using a small variety of the many form controls that are available.
example1.title=Simple Text Box
example1.description=This is just about the most simple example that can be provided. It is just the a text box with no labels or behaviour configured where its value is mapped to a name attribute.

example2.title=Labelled Text Box
example2.description=This time the TextBox is contained within a form. After clicking the 'OK' button you will be able to go to 'Pub/Sub Logging' tab you will be able to see the value entered included in the published payload for the form confirmation topic ('SAVE'). The TextBox configuration now also includes attributes for setting the label, description, units for the control. These attributes are common to all Aikau form controls.

example3.title=Requirement
example3.description=If we want to ensure that the user enters a value into the field before the form is submitted it is possible to define 'requirementConfig'. In this example we use the simple 'initialValue' attribute to ensure that a value is provided (in later examples we will provide dynamic validation). Notice that the 'OK' button is automatically disabled when the field is empty. Also in this example we have configured the 'placeHolder' text - this is common to some (but not all) text based form controls. It is also possible to configure 'visibilityConfig' and 'disablementConfig' in exactly the same way.

example4.title=Regular Expression Validation
example4.description=In the previous examples it was possible to submit non-numerical data into the form control. This doesn't make much sense for a field designed to capture age. This time the TextBox includes 'validationConfig' that specifies a Regular Expression that ensures that only numbers can be entered into the field. Try entering non-numerical data and notice how the 'OK' button is automatically disabled.

example5.title=Multiple Validators
example5.description=It is possible to define more than one validator. In this example we are adding the 'numericalRange' validator to ensure that only ages between 18 and 65 can be entered. Other validators you can experiment with are 'minLength', 'maxLength', 'validateUnique' and 'validationTopic'. It is also possible to create custom validators in custom form controls.

example6.title=Progressive Disclosure
example6.description=It is possible to configure 'visibilityConfig', 'requirementConfig' and 'disablementConfig' so that they dynamically respond to changes in the values of other fields. In this example we are adding an additional CheckBox that can be used to control whether or not the TextBox is visible. It's possible to configure multiple rules and use the 'isNot' attribute instead of the 'is' attribute.

example7.title=Avoid Posting Hidden fields
example7.description=In some instances you might want to avoid posting the value of a field if it is displayed. This example demonstrates how you can configure the 'postWhenHiddenOrDisabled' to be true so that when the TextBox is hidden the value you've entered won't be inclued in the payload for the 'SAVE' topic (you can check this on the 'Pub/Sub Logging' tab).

example8.title=Multiple Controls for the field
example8.description=In this example we are using two different controls for the same data ('value'). The RadioButtons control is configured with the 'noPostWhenValueIs' attribute to indicate that its value should NOT be used when the 'Custom' option is selected. The TextBox is hidden is only displayed when that option is selected and uses the 'postWhenHiddenOrDisabled' attribute so that its value is only published when it is hidden. In this way the two form controls do not attempt to set the same attribute in the payload published for the form. This example also shows how you can configure 'fixedOptions' for form controls that support them.
