page.title=Breadcrumb Trails
page.description=The 'alfresco/documentlibrary/AlfBreadcrumbTrail' provides a versatile way in which paths can be rendered. It was originally written for use in the Aikau version of the Document Library but be adapted for other purposes.

example1.title=Individual Configuration
example1.description=In this example the individual configuration for each breadcrumb is provided. The only required attribute is the 'label' - but additional attributes can be provided such as 'publishTopic' and 'publishPayload'. This is the most flexible way in which to create a breadcrumb trail but does require the most configuration within the page model.

example2.title=Simple Path
example2.description=This example shows how a path can be rendered from a simple string. It also shows how a root breadcrumb can be rendered using the 'showRootLabel' - try switching this to false and re-rendering.

example3.title=Subscription Topic
example3.description=It is possible to configure the 'pathChangeTopic' in order to re-render the breadcrumb trail as the path changes. This typically occurs in a Document Library that is configured to NOT use the browser hash (see next example). Click the button to re-render the breadcrumb trail. Also note that we're setting a custom root breadcrumb label by configuring 'rootLabel'.

example4.title=Using the Browser Hash
example4.description=In this example we are configured the breadcrumb trail to be set using the browser hash. Try manually editing the URL to include '#path=/new/path' (you may need to reload the page with the new URL depending on your browser) to see that the configured 'currentPath' is overridden by the 'path' hash parameter.

example5.title=Publication Configuration
example5.description=In this example we are configuring publications for all the breadcrumbs. The key thing to note here is that the 'path' for the breadcrumb is assigned to each individual breadcrumb - so you should ideally make use of the 'processInstanceTokens' with a {path} token to ensure that the payload published for each breadcrumb is different.

example6.title=Last Breadcrumb Publication Configuration
example6.description=It is also possible to publish payload configuration for ONLY the last breadcrumb. The reason that this capability exists is that in the Document Library there is a requirement for the last breadcrumb to be used to navigate to a details page for the folder (as opposed to just navigating around the document library). This configuration option can be used with the general publication configuration in the previous example - the last breadcrumb configuration will take precedence of the general configuration.
