page.title=alfresco/html/SVGImage
page.description=The SVGImage widget has been provided to allow SVG to be used to render images instead of actual image files. This widget makes use of the svg4everybody library to handle asynchronous retrieval of SVG data and to provide shims and fallbacks for browsers that do not natively support SVG.

example1.description=In this example an image of a pencil is rendered using SVG. Note that you can set the 'height' and 'width' dimensions of the image (pixels are assumed if no units are provided) and that it is also possible optionally configure it to publish a payload when actioned (the usual publication configuration options are supported, i.e; 'publishTopic', 'publishPayload', 'publishGlobal', 'publishToParent', 'publishPayloadType', 'publishPayloadItemMixin' and 'publishPayloadModifiers'). The 'source' attribute defines where the SVG should be loaded from (if not provided an internal SVG library is used) and the 'symbol' attribute selects the SVG <symbol> definition within that source file to be rendered.
