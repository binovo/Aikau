page.title=alfresco/renderers/ToggleStateActions
page.description=This is an extension to the 'alfresco/renderers/Actions' widget that adds a secondary "off" state where no actions are available. Clicking the button toggles the widget into the "on" state and allows the actions menu to be displayed. The original use case for this widget was in sharing documents - the "off" state was the document not being shared, clicking the button would share the document (and move it into the "on" state) and provide additional actions in the drop-down menu.
example1.title=Basic Example
example1.description=This shows an example of how the widget was expected to be used. This widget would typically be used within a list but in this example we're explicitly setting the "currentItem" object - notice how the "currentItem" object has attributes that match both the "itemKeyProperty" (used to uniquely identify the appropriate widget when many are on the page) and the "toggleStateProperty". In this example "toggleOnWhenPropertySet" is configured to be true so that the widget is in the "on" state if the property is found, the alternative would be to define a specific "toggleStateOnValue" to compare the "toggleStateProperty" against. Note that the "toggleOnRequestTopic" and "toggleOnSuccessTopic" are identical - normally a service would subscribe to the "toggleOnRequestTopic" and publish the "toggleOnSuccessTopic" but they are configured the same here for simplicity.
