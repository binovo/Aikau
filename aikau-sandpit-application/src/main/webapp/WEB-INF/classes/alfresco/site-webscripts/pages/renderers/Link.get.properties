page.title=alfresco/renderers/Link
page.description=This is an extension to the 'alfresco/renderers/PropertyLink' widget that allows any value to be used as the link text (compared with the PropertyLink that requires the text to be generated from a property of the current item).
example1.title=Basic Example
example1.description=This shows how a basic link can be created. In this example we are defining the 'currentItem' within the example, but typically it would actually be inherited from an widget ancestor (typically it will be an element of data being rendered by a list). We are using data from the 'currentItem' to create a custom payload.
